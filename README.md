# C_program
Hello World!

My name is Amit Singh and I'm a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Science) student at SGRRITS, Dehradun, U.K, India. I love coding and designing new projects, and for that I use the C programming language as it very fast and easy to code in, Also I have some major interest towards Web Development.

This repository contains all the C language code. Here I will be uploading projects that I have made so far.
