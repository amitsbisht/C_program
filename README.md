# C_program
Hello World!

My name is Amit Singh and I'm a BCA student at SGRRITS, Dehradun, U.K, India. I love coding and designing new projects, and for that I love the C programming language. Also I have some major interest towards Web Development.

This repository contains all the C language code. Here I will be pasting my few projects I have made so far.
